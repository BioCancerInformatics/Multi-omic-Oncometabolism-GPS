HULC increased SPHK1 in hepatoma cells. Mechanistically, HULC activated the promoter of SPHK1 in hepatoma cells through the transcription factor E2F1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) further showed that E2F1 was capable of binding to the E2F1 element in the SPHK1 promoter. HULC increased the expression of E2F1 in hepatoma cells and levels of HULC were positively correlated with those of E2F1 in HCC tissues. Intriguingly, HULC sequestered miR-107, which targeted E2F1 mRNA 3'UTR, by complementary base pairing. Functionally, si-SPHK1 remarkably abolished the HULC-enhanced tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, we conclude that HULC promotes tumor angiogenesis in liver cancer through miR-107/E2F1/SPHK1 signaling.

SNHG17 positively regulated SNORA71B in PC cell lines and other cell lines. SNHG17 sponged miR-339-5p to upregulate STAT5A and therefore to cause transactivation of SNORA71B. Rescue experiments delineated that SNORA71B was required for the regulation of SNHG17 on PC. Moreover, SNHG17 silence hindered tumorigenesis of PC in vivo. In conclusion, current study first revealed that lncRNA SNHG17 aggravated prostate cancer progression through regulating its homolog SNORA71B via a positive feedback loop, which might do help to the pursuit of better PC treatment.

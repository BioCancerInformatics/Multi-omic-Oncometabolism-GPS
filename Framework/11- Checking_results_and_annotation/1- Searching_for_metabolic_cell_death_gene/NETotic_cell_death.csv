"NETotic_cell_death","ELANE","elastase, neutrophil expressed","ENSG00000197561.7","protein_coding",29150539,"In long-term (2-4 hour) 100 nM PMA stimulation, ELANE can promote F-actin degradation, releasing proteases into the nucleus . This suggests a specific role of ELANE in NET formation."
"NETotic_cell_death","MPO","myeloperoxidase","ENSG00000005381.9","protein_coding",20974816,"Intracellular ROS would drive NETotic cell death (1) by triggering the release of elastase, neutrophil expressed (ELANE), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) from neutrophil granules to the cytosol, followed by their translocation to the nucleus, and (2) by promoting the MPO-dependent proteolytic activity of ELANE."
"NETotic_cell_death","CAMP","cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide","ENSG00000164047.6","protein_coding",30948788,"NETosis is a dynamic process and relies on multiple signals and steps including NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production, autophagy, the release and translocation of granular enzymes (e.g., elastase, neutrophil expressed [ELANE], matrix metalloproteinase [MMP], and myeloperoxidase [MPO]) and peptides from the cathelecidin family (e.g., cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide [CAMP, also known as LL37]) from the cytosol to the nucleus."
"NETotic_cell_death","PADI4","peptidyl arginine deiminase 4","ENSG00000159339.13","protein_coding",20733033,"Histone hypercitrullination mediated by PADI4 is the prerequisite for chromatin decondensation, which is necessary for NET formation. It has been proved by experiments that PADI4 depletion leads to a lack of NET formation and deficient bacterial killing by NETs."
"NETotic_cell_death","SLC8A1","solute carrier family 8 member A1","ENSG00000183023.19","protein_coding",33933883,"By using amiloride derivatives EIPA and MIA to inhibit the forward Na+/Ca2+ exchange, it was found that NCX-dependent interstitial cell Ca2+ signaling can be triggered, leading to intracellular ROS accumulation and causing infection-independent NETotic cell death."
"NETotic_cell_death","RAF1","Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase","ENSG00000132155.14","protein_coding",29362479,"NETotic cell death has been suggested to result from a signaling pathway that involves Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (RAF1), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAP2Ks), and ERK2, culminating with NADPH oxidase activation and consequent ROS generation."
"NETotic_cell_death","CSF3","colony stimulating factor 3","ENSG00000108342.13","protein_coding",27994595,"CSF3 not only helps increase neutrophil counts during pregnancy but also promotes progressively enhanced NETosis. The experimental results indicate that CSF3 is an important contributor to the pro-NETotic state during pregnancy. Early in pregnancy, enhanced NETosis seems to be largely driven by hCG, and the contribution of CSF3 is minimal. During pregnancy, high concentrations of CSF3 not only help increase the pool of circulating neutrophils but also promote a primed pro-NETotic phenotype."
"NETotic_cell_death","PADI4","peptidyl arginine deiminase 4","ENSG00000159339.13","protein_coding",27994595,"PADI4 is an isomerase that can lead to histone H3 arginine being citrullinated, causing chromatin decondensation and the formation of NETs."
"NETotic_cell_death","AURKA","aurora kinase A","ENSG00000087586.18","protein_coding",30948788,"AURKA promotes Netotic cell death by controlling microtubule plasticity."

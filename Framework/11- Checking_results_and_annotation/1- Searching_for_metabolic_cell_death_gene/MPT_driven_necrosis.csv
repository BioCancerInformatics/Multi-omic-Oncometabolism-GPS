"MPT_driven_necrosis","ATP5F1A","ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha","ENSG00000152234","protein_coding",30874894,"ATP5A1 is a subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase complex V, while MPT is the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, whose opening is one of the important mechanisms leading to necrosis. The study showed that up-regulation of mitochondrial CAPN1 can inhibit the expression of ATP5A1 and the activity of ATP synthase and induce the opening of MPT."

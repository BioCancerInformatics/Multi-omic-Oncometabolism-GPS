"Parthanatos","PARP1","poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1","ENSG00000143799.14","protein_coding",32251407,"Studies have shown that by inhibiting the activity of PARP1, it is possible to change the mechanism of cell death caused by MNNG-camptothecin from parthanatotic to apoptotic. This suggests that PARP1 mediates interactions between parthanatotic and apoptotic death pathways, leading to antagonism and single agent dominance."
"Parthanatos","MIF","macrophage migration inhibitory factor","ENSG00000240972.2","protein_coding",35545089,"As a part of PAAN/MIF nuclease, MIF mediates the large-scale DNA fragmentation in the process of Parthanatos. Neutralizing the nuclease activity of PAAN/MIF can protect dopaminergic neurons from the Parthanatos damage induced by pathological ¦Á-syn."
"Parthanatos","AIFM1","apoptosis inducing factor mitochondria associated 1","ENSG00000156709.15","protein_coding",27817117,"In comparing the mechanisms of cell death in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), the disease induces cells to die by virus-induced PARP and AIFM1 transport, a process known as Parthanatos."
"Parthanatos","HSPA4","heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 4","ENSG00000170606.16","protein_coding",37060999,"Reactive sulfur species prevent Parthanatos by inhibiting the p62-based aggresome-like induced structures formation through the induction of HSP70, which is a member of the heat shock protein 70 family (HSP70 family) including HSPA4."
"Parthanatos","ADPRS","ADP-ribosylserine hydrolase [Homo sapiens","ENSG00000116863","protein_coding",33171306,"Under oxidative stress conditions, ARH3-deficient cells show increased PAR accumulation and PARP1-mediated cell death, which plays an important role in regulating the growth of various tumors."
"Parthanatos","RNF146","ring finger protein 146","ENSG00000118518.17","protein_coding",33443209,"RNF146 inhibits the parthanatos cell death pathway by inhibiting the overactivation of PARP1. Activation of the Akt1-CREB-RNF146 pathway can increase the survival of cultured cells in the presence of dopamine neurotoxins."
"Parthanatos","ADPRS","ADP-ribosylserine hydrolase","ENSG00000116863.11","protein_coding",24191052,"ADPRS and PARG jointly regulate PAR metabolism, and ADPRS reduces PAR levels in the nucleus and cytoplasm, preventing PAR translocation, transportation, and Parthanatos, thereby reducing the likelihood of PAR-dependent AIF release from mitochondria.ADPRS is related to Parthanatos by regulating cell death through the degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). The excess PAR triggers cell death through various mechanisms, including the release of protein-free PAR molecules by the PARG step during AIF-mediated cell death."
"Parthanatos","OGG1","8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase","ENSG00000114026.22","protein_coding",29795387,"Genetic or siRNA-mediated ablation of Ogg1, as well as the expression of enzymatically deficient OGG1, decreased the accumulation of DNA strand breaks, PARP1 overactivation, and AIF nuclear translocation, resulting in increased resistance to ROS-induced parthanatos."
"Parthanatos","HSF1","heat shock transcription factor 1","ENSG00000185122.11","protein_coding",37060999,"Na2S4 activates HSF1 and promotes its dissociation from HSP90, leading to the accelerated transcription of HSP70. Conversely, the inhibitors of RSS-producing enzymes, such as 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and cystathionine ¦Ã-lyase, clearly enhanced ALIS formation and subsequent Parthanatos. Furthermore, the genetic deletion of HSP70 allowed the enhanced ALIS formation, suggesting that RSS prevent Parthanatos by specifically suppressing ALIS formation through the induction of HSP70."
"Parthanatos","HSP90AA1","heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1","ENSG00000080824.19","protein_coding",37060999,"Na2S4 promotes the persulfidation of Hsp90-Cys521, leading to dissociation of Hsp90 from HSF1 and subsequent activation of HSF1 and HSP70 transcription. Ultimately, the upregulated HSP70 promotes the proteasomal degradation of denatured proteins, preventing Parthanatos."
"Parthanatos","PARG","poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase","ENSG00000227345.9","protein_coding",24191052,"PARG participates in the mechanism of Parthanatos by catalyzing the hydrolysis of PAR on PARP1 to generate protein-free PAR molecules, which act as signals to release AIF from mitochondrial membranes."

"Necroptosis","CYBB","cytochrome b-245 beta chain","ENSG00000165168","protein_coding",31328381,"NOX2 is linked to both cardiac remodeling and the progression of chronic heart failure. As an important oxidative stress-related enzyme on the membrane of cardiac cells, NOX2 is known to be associated with these processes. In the membrane fraction of non-infarcted tissue, where necroptosis occurs, NOX2 levels were higher than in the sham group."
"Necroptosis","USP21","ubiquitin specific peptidase 21","ENSG00000143258.17","protein_coding",34698396,"USP21 naturally contains a CaaX motif, which targets it to membranes and the researchers used a USP21 mutant, in which Cys221 was mutated to Arg, making it unable to deubiquitinate."
"Necroptosis","PARP1","poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1","ENSG00000143799.14","protein_coding",22814620,"Under TRAIL treatment, PARP-1 activity increased at acidic extracellular pH, leading to intracellular ATP depletion and ultimately cell death."
"Necroptosis","CHMP4C","charged multivesicular body protein 4C","ENSG00000164695.5","protein_coding",36685937,"CHMP4C is one of the highly expressed DENRGs, and DENRGs are one of the genes related to Necroptosis. CHMP4C is highly expressed in CC tissues and cell lines and plays a role as a pro-oncogene in them."
"Necroptosis","OPTN","optineurin","ENSG00000123240.17","protein_coding",27493188,"The absence of Optineurin leads to progressive dysmyelination and axonal degeneration in the central nervous system through the engagement of necroptotic machinery, including RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL."

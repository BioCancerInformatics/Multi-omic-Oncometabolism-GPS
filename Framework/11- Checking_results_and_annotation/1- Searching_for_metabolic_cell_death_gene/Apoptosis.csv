In addition, processes such as diabetes, vaccination, oxidative stress can activate the PLCG1 gene and enhance cell survival."
"Apoptosis","PRKACA","protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha","ENSG00000072062.16","protein_coding",35295332,"In the scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment mouse model, PRKACA is a protein related to dopaminergic synapse and apoptosis signaling pathways. The PPI network shows that PRKACA plays an important role in the apoptosis pathway."
"Apoptosis","SCAF11","SR-related CTD associated factor 11","ENSG00000139218.18","protein_coding",35309514,"SCAF11, as an intracellular receptor for LPS, regulates pyroptosis and promotes the progression of liver cancer.The researchers conducted loss-of-function experiments on liver cancer cell lines and found that suppression of SCAF11 expression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, and induced apoptosis."
"Apoptosis","AIM2","absent in melanoma 2","ENSG00000163568.16","protein_coding",25879280,"The AIM2 inflammasome can induce both pyroptosis and apoptosis. Specifically, AIM2 can activate caspase-8 to induce apoptosis in the absence of caspase-1."
"Apoptosis","GSDMA","gasdermin A","ENSG00000167914.12","protein_coding",33406603,"GSDMA is a member of the protein family that can activate cell apoptosis. It is regulated by antigen particles released from tumor cells, which can be recognized by cytotoxic lymphocytes to promote the body's immune system to attack and destroy tumor cells. GSDMA regulates the apoptotic process of tumor cells through oxidative stress and chemokine action."
"Apoptosis","IL6","interleukin 6","ENSG00000136244.12","protein_coding",30918019,"IL6 regulates cell survival and proliferation by activating STAT3 and participates in the regulation of pathways such as cell cycle, P53 signaling pathway, cancer miRNA, and other signaling pathways in cancer. Therefore, IL6 may be involved in regulating cell apoptosis in these pathways. In addition, CKLF1 inhibits apoptosis by activating the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway, suggesting the influence of IL6 on apoptosis."
"Apoptosis","NOD2","nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing 2","ENSG00000167207.15","protein_coding",11385576,"NOD2 normally makes cells sensitive to microbial components and suppresses the release of proinflammatory cytokines by activating NF-kB.NOD2 was found to activate NF-kB, which is an important factor regulating both inflammatory response and cell death. Moreover, the study suggests that defects in NOD2 protein affect the activation and signaling of NF-kB."
"Apoptosis","FOXO3","forkhead box O3","ENSG00000118689.15","protein_coding",29938591,"FOXO3 is found to link the cell's autophagy and apoptosis through a transcriptional mechanism. When autophagy is inhibited, FOXO3 upregulates the transcription of the pro-apoptotic gene BBC3/PUMA, making the cell more prone to undergo apoptosis."
"Apoptosis","PARL","presenilin associated rhomboid like","ENSG00000175193.14","protein_coding",16839872,"PARL cleaves OPA1 to generate a shorter form of OPA1 that is critical for maintaining the bottleneck configuration of cristae and the compartmentalization of proteins, including cytochrome c, which protects mitochondria from apoptosis."

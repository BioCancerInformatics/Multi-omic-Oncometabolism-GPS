"Oxeiptosis","PGAM5","PGAM family member 5, mitochondrial serine/threonine protein phosphatase","ENSG00000247077.8","protein_coding",29844568,"PGAM5, a mitochondrial serine-threonine phosphatase, participates in the activation of a novel signaling pathway that couples a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensor to a cytotoxic program. The KEAP1-PGAM5-AIFM1 axis is critical for the execution of this cell death program. PGAM5 activates AIFM1, which executes the cytotoxic program. Thus, PGAM5 contributes to the execution of oxeiptosis by binding and dephosphorylating AIFM1 at Ser116."
"Oxeiptosis","KEAP1","kelch like ECH associated protein 1","ENSG00000079999.14","protein_coding",29844568,"KEAP1 functions as a critical switch that quantitatively monitors intracellular ROS levels. Oxidation of cysteine residues in KEAP1 by ROS triggers conformational changes and leads to the release of the transcription factor NRF2.the study suggests that KEAP1 forms a tri-partite complex with NRF2 and the mitochondrial serine-threonine phosphatase PGAM5. PGAM5 is a key downstream effector of the oxeiptosis pathway that culminates in the execution of a cytotoxic program when trapped in high ROS levels."
"Oxeiptosis","AIFM1","apoptosis inducing factor mitochondria associated 1","ENSG00000156709.15","protein_coding",29844568,"Mass spectrometry identified that AIFM1 is among the cellular interaction partners of PGAM5, a key downstream effector of oxeiptosis. Knockdown experiments of AIFM1 alone or in combination with PGAM5 and KEAP1 reduced ROS-mediated cell death, indicating a linear signal transduction pathway along the KEAP1-PGAM5-AIFM1 axis. The authors further showed that PGAM5 dephosphorylates Ser116 of AIFM1, which is a read-out of oxeiptosis activation, and that AIFM1 does not translocate to other cellular compartments in their experimental system."
"Oxeiptosis","NFE2L1","NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 1","ENSG00000082641.16","protein_coding",36626243,"Nrf2 is involved in the inhibition of Oxeiptosis and resizes the effect of ROS on cells by regulating the expression of PGAM5 and AIFM1."
"Oxeiptosis","GPX4","glutathione peroxidase 4","ENSG00000167468.20","protein_coding",29255269,"GPX4 is an antioxidant enzyme that can degrade ROS and prevent their accumulation. Decreased GPX4 activity under conditions of deficiency may promote the occurrence of Oxeiptosis."
"Oxeiptosis","OTUD1 ","OTU deubiquitinase 1","ENSG00000165312","protein_coding",35941131,"OTUD1 directly interacts with KEAP1 and regulates its K63-ubiquitination, thereby counteracting ROS production and Oxeiptosis. The deficiency of OTUD1 results in mitochondrial damage and increased ROS production."
"Oxeiptosis","NFKB1","nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1","","protein_coding",35941131,"OTUD1 functions by hydrolyzing K63-linked ubiquitin chains from NFKB1 signaling factors, including LUBAC, to suppress LUBAC-induced NFKB1 activation."
"Oxeiptosis","CASP3","caspase 3","ENSG00000164305.20","protein_coding",35263194,"Alloimperatorin can activate CASP3 (caspase-3) to promote the dephosphorylation of AIFM1, which leads to oxeipotic cell death, a form of Oxeiptosis."
"Oxeiptosis","SOD1","superoxide dismutase 1","ENSG00000142168.15","protein_coding",30948788,"SOD1 is a superoxide dismutase that clears superoxide radicals inside the cell. Oxeiptosis is a ROS-dependent, apoptosis-like, non-caspase protease-mediated cell death pathway. In H2O2-induced Oxeiptosis, SOD1 has been shown to inhibit the pathway."
"Oxeiptosis","SOD2","superoxide dismutase 2","ENSG00000291237.1","protein_coding",30948788,"SOD2 (Superoxide dismutase 2) is an antioxidant enzyme in mitochondria that plays a protective role in Oxeiptosis."

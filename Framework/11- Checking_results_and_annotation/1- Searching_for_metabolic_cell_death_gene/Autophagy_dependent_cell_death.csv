When phosphorylated at Ser351, p62 binds to aggregates of ubiquitylated proteins and increases its affinity for Keap1. This event induces Keap1 degradation via autophagy, leaving Nrf2 free to accumulate and translocate in the nucleus. Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant-responsive elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of antioxidant and detoxifying genes."

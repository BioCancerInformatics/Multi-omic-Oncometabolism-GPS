Apoptosis	SIRT1	sirtuin 1	ENSG00000096717.12	protein_coding	34987698	SIRT1 participates in apoptosis of nucleus pulposus cells. Apoptosis of intervertebral disc cells caused by mechanical overload is a core cause of intervertebral disc degeneration. The results showed that high-magnitude compression triggers cellular apoptosis and reduces the expression levels of SIRT1 and microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3B (LC3B) in rat NPCs. However, SIRT1 overexpression in NPCs partly reduced these indicators. The upregulation of SIRT1 increases the formation of the LC3B/Fas complex, which suppresses NPC apoptosis by inhibiting the NF-百B pathway under high compressive stress, and reduces activation of the NF-百B pathway. The study suggests that SIRT1 plays a major role in the regulation of various cellular processes related to oxidative stress, metabolism, cell senescence, apoptosis, and autophagy.

Over-expression of miR-106b-5p reversed the effects of H19 on cell viability and ferroptosis in BMVECs. Furthermore, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) was verified to be a target gene of miR-106b-5p and was highly expressed in OGD/H-treated cells.

Using a dual-luciferase assay, we confirmed the binding between MEG8 and miR-497-5p, and between the miR-497-5p and 3'UTR of NOTCH2. We further found that silencing MEG8 significantly decreased the expressions of SLC7A11 and GPX4 both in mRNA and protein level and had no effect on the level of AIFM2. Importantly, blocking miR-497-5p abrogated the effects of MEG8 loss on cell viability, MDA level and expression levels of NOTCH2, SLC7A11 and GPX4 in HemECs.

Ferroptosis	PVT1	Pvt1 oncogene	ENSG00000249859.14	lncRNA	32827544	We found that the levels of PVT1 were upregulated and miR-214 levels were downregulated in plasma of AIS patients. NIHSS score was positively correlated with PVT1 levels but was negatively with miR-214 levels. PVT1 silencing or miR-214 overexpression significantly reduced infarct size and suppressed ferroptosis in vivo. miR-214 overexpression markedly decreased PVT1 levels. Specifically, miR-214 could bind to 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of PVT1, TP53 or TFR1. PVT1 overexpression or miR-214 silencing markedly abolished the effects of Ferrostatin-1 on ferroptosis indicators except for TFR1 expression.

Mechanistically, ACSL4 was required for the regulation on ferroptosis and growth of glioblastoma cells by miR-670-3p. Moreover, U87MG and A172 cells treated with miR-670-3p inhibitor showed an increased chemosensitivity to TMZ.

The miR-382-5p expression was down-regulated but SLC7A11 expression was up-regulated in clinical ovarian and breast cancer samples. Furthermore, the treatment of lidocaine repressed tumor growth of ovarian cancer cells in vivo, in which the miR-382-5p expression was increased while SLC7A11 expression was decreased. Consequently, we concluded that the lidocaine promoted ferroptosis by miR-382-5p/SLC7A11 axis in ovarian and breast cancer cells.

Furthermore, the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 could mimic the effect of miR-324-3p upregulation in increasing the sensitivity of the cisplatin-resistant cells to the drug. Significantly, miR-324-3p enhanced cisplatin-induced ferroptosis in the A549/DDP cells.

Further studies showed that the effect of miR-324-3p was mediated by directly targeting glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). miR-324-3p bound to the 3雿?UTR of GPX4 and led to the downregulation of GPX4. In vivo studies showed that metformin induced ferroptosis by upregulating miR-324-3p in the xenograft model of breast cancer in mice.
Ferroptosis	MIR182	microRNA 182	ENSG00000207990.3	miRNA	33116120	We identified that miR-182-5p and miR-378a-3p were upregulated in the ferroptosis and H/R-induced injury, and correlates reversely with glutathione peroxidases 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) expression in renal I/R injury tissues, respectively. In vitro studies showed that miR-182-5p and miR-378a-3p induced ferroptosis in cells. We further found that miR-182-5p and miR-378a-3p regulated the expression of GPX4 and SLC7A11 negatively by directly binding to the 3'UTR of GPX4 and SLC7A11 mRNA. In vivo study showed that silencing miR-182-5p and miR-378a-3p alleviated the I/R-induced renal injury in rats.
Ferroptosis	MIR137	microRNA 137	ENSG00000284202.1	miRNA	33100224	miR-137 overexpression boosts the neuroprotective effects of EPC-EXs against apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in oxyHb-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, EXsmiR-137 rather than EXs can restore the decrease in miR-137 levels and inhibit ferroptosis, and the protection mechanism might involve the miR-137-COX2/PGE2 signaling pathway.
Ferroptosis	MIR424	microRNA 424	ENSG00000284231.1	miRNA	33038905	We show that miR-424-5p negatively regulates ferroptosis by directly targeting ACSL4 in ovarian cancer cells. Upregulation of miR-424-5p suppressed ACSL4 by directly binding to its 3'-UTR, which subsequently reduced erastin- and RSL3-induced ferroptosis. Meanwhile, knockdown of miR-424-5p increased the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to erastin and RSL3. Furthermore, ACSL4 was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues, and high ACSL4 expression predicted worse prognosis and sensitized ovarian cancer cells to erastin- and RSL3-induced ferroptosis. Importantly, decreases in lipid peroxides and ferroptotic cell death mediated by miR-424-5p could be abrogated by ACSL4 overexpression.

Ferroptosis	NEAT1	nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1	ENSG00000245532.11	lncRNA	35338333	We found that ferroptosis inducers erastin and RSL3 increased NEAT1 expression by promoting the binding of p53 to the NEAT1 promoter. Induced NEAT1 promoted the expression of MIOX by competitively binding to miR-362-3p. MIOX increased ROS production and decreased the intracellular levels of NADPH and GSH, resulting in enhanced erastin- and RSL3-induced ferroptosis. Importantly, overexpression of NEAT1 increased the anti-tumor activity of erastin and RSL3 by enhancing ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo.
Ferroptosis	H19	H19 imprinted maternally expressed transcript	ENSG00000130600.21	lncRNA	35224289	Overexpression of lncRNA H19 eliminated the anticancer effect of curcumenol, while lncRNA H19 knockdown promoted ferroptosis induced by curcumenol treatment. Mechanistically, we showed that lncRNA H19 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA to bind to miR-19b-3p, thereby enhanced the transcription activity of its endogenous target, ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), a marker of ferroptosis. In conclusion, our data show that the natural product curcumenol exerted its antitumor effects on lung cancer by triggering ferroptosis, and the lncRNA H19/miR-19b-3p/FTH1 axis plays an essential role in curcumenol-induced ferroptotic cell death.

Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) is a downstream target of miR-140-5p, which induces ferroptosis via inhibition of GSH synthesis by targeting SLC7A11. Attenuating exosomal-miR-140-5p expression alleviates ferroptosis and cardiac injury induced by obese ATM exosomes by alleviating GSH inhibition.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the genes that have important functions in the development of cis-AKI. In the present study, GPX4 was predicted as a target of miR-214-3p. Moreover, inhibiting miR-214-3p enhanced the expressions of GPX4 and SLC7A11 while decreasing the ACSL4 expression. Furthermore, miR-214-3p down-regulation protected against TEC death and renal tubule damage both in vitro and in vivo.

Then, upregulated miR-21-3p was proved to facilitate IFN-蝥?mediated ferroptosis by potentiating lipid peroxidation. miR-21-3p increased the ferroptosis sensitivity by directly targeting thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) to enhance lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Furthermore, miR-21-3p overexpression in tumor synergized with anti-PD-1 antibody by promoting tumor cell ferroptosis. More importantly, miR-21-3p-loaded gold nanoparticles were constructed, and the systemic delivery of them increased the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody without prominent side effects in preclinical mice model. Ultimately, ATF3 was found to promote miR-21-3p transcription in IFN-蝥?driven ferroptosis.
Ferroptosis	MIR222	microRNA 222	ENSG00000207725.3	miRNA	34978008	The results showed that supplementation of exosomes derived from HBV-infected LO2 cells remarkably enhanced LX-2 cell activation, evidenced by elevated hydroxyprolin (Hyp) secretion and 隡?SMA and COL1A2 expression. miR-222 was significantly increased in HBV-Exo. Overexpressing miR-222 upregulated cell viability, secretion of Hpy, and expression of 隡?SMA and COL1A2, which were all blocked by overexpression of TFRC.

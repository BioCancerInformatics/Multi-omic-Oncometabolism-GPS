"Entotic_cell_death","ATG5","autophagy related 5","ENSG00000057663.16","protein_coding",22002674,"The research found that ATG5, along with other autophagy proteins such as ATG7, played a critical role in Entotic cell death. When the expression of ATG5 was inhibited, the death of internalized cells was also reduced."
"Entotic_cell_death","ATG7","autophagy related 7","ENSG00000197548.13","protein_coding",22002674,"ATG7, an autophagy protein, is essential for facilitating lysosome fusion with single-membrane vacuoles, including entotic vacuoles, and the successful degradation of their internalized cargo. In the presence of autophagy proteins, LC3 and ATG7 recruit to the Entotic vacuole membrane and ultimately contribute to the cell's death."

"Disulfidptosis","FLNA","filamin A","ENSG00000196924.19","protein_coding",36747082,"FLNA participates in disulfidptosis by mediating the collapse of F-actin in response to intracellular disulfide stress induced by glucose starvation in SLC7A11high cells. This leads to the formation of aberrant disulfide bonds in actin cytoskeleton proteins, which contributes to disulfidptosis."
"Disulfidptosis","FLNB","filamin B","ENSG00000136068.16","protein_coding",36747082,"Abnormal accumulation of intracellular disulfides leads to abnormal disulfide bonding in the intracellular actin backbone, the formation of disulfide fusion complexes, and ultimately cell death."

"Disulfidptosis","ACTB","actin beta","ENSG00000075624.17","protein_coding",36747082,"In cells with high SLC7A11 expression, glucose starvation induces abnormal cysteine bonds to bind to the actin skeleton protein, and F-actin collapses, leading to disulfidptosis."
"Disulfidptosis","MYL6","myosin light chain 6","ENSG00000092841.19","protein_coding",36747082,"Experimental results indicate that glucose starvation leads to abnormal disulfide bonding in actin cytoskeleton proteins including MYL6 in SLC7A11high cells, which is involved in disulfidptosis. "
"Disulfidptosis","MYH10","myosin heavy chain 10","ENSG00000133026.14","protein_coding",36747082,"MYH10 Blots show that in UMRC6 cells with high SLC7A11 expression, glucose starvation induces cell death by leading to F-actin collapse and abnormal disulfide bond formation."
"Disulfidptosis","CAPZB","capping actin protein of muscle Z-line subunit beta","ENSG00000077549.19","protein_coding",36747082,"GLUT inhibitors induce disulfidptosis in SLC7A11high tumor cells, leading to abnormal oxidative and depolymerization of CAPZB, which disrupts the stability of actin filaments."
"Disulfidptosis","DSTN","destrin, actin depolymerizing factor","ENSG00000125868.16","protein_coding",36747082,"DSTN is an actin filament-cutting protein involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration. DSTN plays a role in the formation of disulfide bonds in actin cytoskeletal proteins."
"Disulfidptosis","IQGAP1","IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1","ENSG00000140575.13","protein_coding",36747082,"IQGAP1 was found to be involved in disulfidptosis through its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. Specifically, IQGAP1 was shown to promote the formation of lamellipodia and actin cytoskeleton polymerization, thereby promoting disulfide crosslinking among actin cytoskeleton proteins and contributing to cell death. Inhibition of IQGAP1 partially inhibited disulfidptosis, indicating its role in this process."
"Disulfidptosis","ACTN4","actinin alpha 4","ENSG00000130402.14","protein_coding",36747082,"This study found that ACTN4 is prone to abnormal disulfide bonding when cells lack glucose, leading to the collapse of cell skeleton and cell death. Therefore, the appearance of ACTN4 indicates that abnormal disulfide bonding in the cell skeleton is an important mechanism of disulfidptosis."
"Disulfidptosis","PDLIM1","PDZ and LIM domain 1","ENSG00000107438.9","protein_coding",36747082,"PDLIM1 is a protein that regulates muscle cell apoptosis and stabilizes muscle cell membrane structure. In this study, PDLIM1 interacts with other proteins to form a network, demonstrating its importance in tumor formation and cell apoptosis."
"Disulfidptosis","CD2AP","CD2 associated protein","ENSG00000198087.7","protein_coding",36747082,"The presence of CD2AP in the PPI network indicates that it is related to the cytoskeleton. Specifically, CD2AP forms complexes with NCK1 and NCK2 that interact with the small GTPase Rac signaling pathway to regulate actin rearrangement and promote cell proliferation and metastasis."
"Disulfidptosis","INF2","inverted formin 2","ENSG00000203485.14","protein_coding",36747082,"INF2 was found to be involved in disulfidptosis by regulating actin polymerization and the formation of lamellipodia. This is shown by the observation that deficient WRC leads to a partial resistance to disulfidptosis. Additionally, the collapse of F-actin during disulfidptosis was observed, and this is thought to be promoted by Rac-WRC-mediated actin polymerization and lamellipodia formation."
"Disulfidptosis","SLC7A11","solute carrier family 7 member 11","ENSG00000151012.13","protein_coding",36747082,"SLC7A11 is involved in disulfidptosis by mediating the susceptibility of the actin cytoskeleton to disulfide stress and inducing aberrant disulfide bonds in actin cytoskeleton proteins, which leads to F-actin collapse and the previously unrecognized form of cell death."
"Disulfidptosis","DECR1","2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 1","ENSG00000104325","protein_coding",36747082,"NADPH provides critical reducing power to resolve disulfide bonding among actin cytoskeleton proteins, thereby suppressing disulfide stress-induced cell death. In SLC7A11high cells under glucose starvation, high cystine uptake coupled with the shortage of NADPH supply leads to NADPH depletion, aberrant disulfide bonding in actin cytoskeleton proteins, actin network collapse, and subsequent cell death."

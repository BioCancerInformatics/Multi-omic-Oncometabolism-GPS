"Alkaliptosis","IKBKB","inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta","ENSG00000104365.16","protein_coding",31467365,"IKBKB is involved in the regulation of Alkaliptosis because the NF-百B signaling pathway, which includes IKBKB, is found to contribute to Alkaliptosis regulation and the process. The NF-百B signaling pathway is a pro-survival pathway, and IKBKB is involved in the release of the negative regulator NFKBIA, which activates this pathway, promoting Alkaliptosis."
"Alkaliptosis","NFKB1","nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1","ENSG00000109320.14","protein_coding",31467365,"After the activation of the NF-百B pathway, as a protective pathway for survival, it can fix free radicals such as active oxygen and maintain the stability of the cell environment to reduce cell death. However, the NF-百B pathway can also regulate other death pathways, such as Alkaliptosis, by down-regulating the expression of Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), thereby inhibiting intracellular alkalization and relieving cell death."
"Alkaliptosis","CA9","carbonic anhydrase 9","ENSG00000107159.14","protein_coding",31467365,"CA9 is identified as a key negative regulator in Alkaliptosis. CA9, which is activated by the NF-百B pathway, is thought to be a negatively regulated gene responsible for inhibiting intracellular alkalinization and resistance to Alkaliptosis."
"Alkaliptosis","CHUK","component of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase complex","ENSG00000213341.11","protein_coding",31467365,"CHUK is related to Alkaliptosis, inducing the release of lactate dehydrogenase and intracellular alkalinization through activating the NF-百B pathway, leading to cell death."
"Alkaliptosis","IKBKG","inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase regulatory subunit gamma","ENSG00000269335.7","protein_coding",31467365,"IKBKG was found to activate the NF-百B pathway by disrupting the function of NFKBIA, leading to the release of NF-百B and subsequent activation of the NF-百B pathway. Moreover, NF-百B affects the expression of carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and inhibits intracellular alkalinization by suppressing CA9 expression."
"Alkaliptosis","RELA","RELA proto-oncogene, NF-kB subunit","ENSG00000173039.20","protein_coding",31467365,"RELA is identified as a transcription factor that mediates the NF-百B pathway by activating the IKK protein complex, phosphorylating and degrading NFKBIA, and regulating the expression of many genes by translocating to the nucleus."
"Alkaliptosis","FN1","fibronectin 1","ENSG00000115414.21","protein_coding",33670487,"The study used an in-silico approach to identify potential drug targets and non-apoptotic cell death-related genes in colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and small cell lung cancer, three types of cancer that are resistant to conventional apoptosis. Through the analysis of the transcriptome profiles of these cancers and literature mining, potential drug targets and non-apoptotic cell death-related genes were identified._he results showed that FN1 was associated with Alkaliptosis in colon adenocarcinoma."
"Alkaliptosis","AGER","advanced glycosylation end-product specific receptor","ENSG00000204305.16","protein_coding",33992959,"AGER participates in Alkaliptosis by binding to HMGB1, leading to the activation of the STING1 pathway and the production of inflammation. Specifically, when the released HMGB1 from Alkaliptotic cells binds to AGER, the STING1 pathway is activated, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL6."
"Alkaliptosis","HMGB1","high mobility group box 1","ENSG00000189403.15","protein_coding",33992959,"During Alkaliptosis, HMGB1 translocates and is released from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and extracellular space, promoting the resulting inflammation. Among the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by dying cells, HMGB1 is a chromatin binding factor that acts as a nuclear DAMP during many types of cell death and mediates immune responses through multiple receptors."
"Alkaliptosis","STING1","stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1","ENSG00000184584.14","protein_coding",33992959,"STING1 is involved in the release of HMGB1 and the production of cytokines after cell death. Once Alkaliptotic cancer cells release HMGB1, extracellular HMGB1 binds to macrophages through the STING1 pathway that is dependent on AGER, and subsequently activates and produces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL6."
"Alkaliptosis","FANCD2","FA complementation group D2","ENSG00000144554.13","protein_coding",33992959,"During Alkaliptosis, DNA damage is an important signal that triggers the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. FANCD2, as one of the key regulatory factors of double-strand break repair, can inhibit the release of HMGB1 by activating a FANCD2-dependent DNA repair pathway"
"Alkaliptosis","NOX4","NADPH oxidase 4","ENSG00000086991.13","protein_coding",31827672,"NOX4 is an important producer of ROS, and ROS is one of the important stimuli that can induce Alkaliptosis."
"Alkaliptosis","ATP6V0D1","ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit d1","ENSG00000159720.13","protein_coding",36640329,"The study used mass-spectrometry-based drug target identification and point mutation technologies to reveal that ATP6V0D1 is a direct target of the opioid analgesic drug JTC801, which drives Alkaliptosis in PDAC cells by inhibiting the STAT3-mediated lysosomal pH homeostasis."
"Alkaliptosis","STAT3","signal transducer and activator of transcription 3","ENSG00000168610.16","protein_coding",36640329,"STAT3 promotes Alkaliptosis by inhibiting the lysosomal pH homeostasis mediated by ATP6V0D1. Functionally, JTC801-mediated ATP6V0D1 protein stability increases the interaction between ATP6V0D1 and STAT3, resulting in increased expression and activity of STAT3 for maintaining lysosomal pH homeostasis."
"Alkaliptosis","ACSS2","acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2","ENSG00000131069.20","protein_coding",36707625,"JTC801 can up-regulate the mRNA and protein expression of ACSS2 and ACSS2 can promote NF-百B-dependent CA9 downregulation through the production of intracellular acetyl-coenzyme A and subsequent histone acetylation, leading to alkaliptosis."
